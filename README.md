# Finetune Challenge

## Food Count

Create a web app where the user has a list of everything she eats and the amount. <br />
:white_check_mark: 1 - The user should be able to add items to the list.<br />
:white_check_mark: 2 - The items are organized by day.<br />
:white_check_mark: 3 - The user can filter items by date.<br />
:white_check_mark: 4 - Each food item can have a type: Protein, Fat, or Carbohydrate.<br />
:white_check_mark: 5 - User can see a graph on the top of the list with the Item type distribution(Protein, Fat, or Carbohydrate).<br />
:white_check_mark: 5.1 - For the backend please create a way to get data for the graph.<br />
:white_check_mark: 5.2 - For the frontend please create a way to display the graph.<br />
:white_check_mark: 6 - Here in Finetune we are huge fans of tests especially TDD, so it's strongly recommended to implement the features using TDD and adding the tests first on the commit, this is optional.<br />
:white_check_mark: 7 - The user can delete items from the list.<br />
This test has a lot of features on purpose, you should feel free to choose the ones you think will make the most impact on the user and showcase your skills.<br />
